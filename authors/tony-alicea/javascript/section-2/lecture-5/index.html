        <h4>Syntax Parsers:</h4>
        <p>
            <span>A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammar is valid.</span> Your code isn't magic. Someone else wrote a program to translate it for the computer.
        </p>
        <h4>Lexical Environment:</h4>
        <p>
            <span>Where something sits physically in the code you write.</span> A lexical environment exists is programming languages in which where you write something is important.
        </p>
        <h4>Execution Context:</h4>
        <p>
            <span>A wrapper to help manage the code that is running.</span> There are lots of lexical environments. Which one is currently running is managed via execution contexts. It can contain things beyong what you've written in your code.
