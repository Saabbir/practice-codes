		<h4>What is Undefined in JavaScript?</h4>
		<p>
			<span>It's a special value. Special keyword. A primitive data type.</span>
			It is initially set to all the variables in the creation phase of the execution context by the JavaScript engine. But you can also set it by yourself in any variable as this is a primitive data type. But never do that. It will be hard to debug later. Leave it for the JavaScript engine so that you know when you see a undefined value of a variable that you never set it.
